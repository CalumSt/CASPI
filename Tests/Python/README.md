This script is used to plot signals generated by unit tests.
Usage:

Run the script:
    
    bash gen_plots.sh

Alternatively, to invoke the python script manually:

(WINDOWS)

    ./.venv/Scripts/activate
    python plot_signals.py <DATA_DIR> <OUTPUT_DIR>

(LINUX / MACOS)
    
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python plot_signals.py <DATA_DIR> <OUTPUT_DIR>

<DATA_DIR> and <OUTPUT_DIR> are both required.
<DATA_DIR> is assumed to contain csv files where one column is the timestamp or sample index (x), and the next is the generated signal.
The title of the plot is the name of the file.
<OUTPUT_DIR> is the directory where you want the plots to be saved.
